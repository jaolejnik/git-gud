# WHAT IS <span class="git"> GIT</span>?
_<span class="git">Git</span> is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency._ 

<span class="audience-question">Ok, but what does it actually mean?</span>

I like to think about it as a very elaborate save system.
Let my real life version explain what I mean!

## CREATING A <span class="git"> GIT</span> REPOSITORY
Let's create a new directory called `repo-test` and then inside this directory create a new file `README.md`.

Next, run this command to initialize as a git repository:
```
$ git init
```

With this command you can turn any directory into a <span class="git">Git</span> repository. It's all thanks to the magical `.git` directory.
Now check for the magical `.git` directory.

<span class="audience-question">What are you talking about?
 I can't see anything like that!</span>

---
## .<span class="git">git</span> DIRECTORY
It is so important, that it is hidden by default.
This is the heart of your git repository.
Without it, no git commands would work.

 Type the following and check again:
 ```
 $ ls -al
 ```
Can you see it now? 

---
## CREATING YOUR FIRST COMMIT
The command I end up using the most is:
```
$ git status
```
It prints out a concise description of the current status of your repository and its contents.

Now you can add some files to be included in the next commit using:
```
$ git add <file>
```
It's also possible to add whole directories, which will add all of its contents.

---
## CREATING YOUR FIRST COMMIT
Now that you have all the desired files added, it's finally time to create a commit.
To do so you use the following command:
```
$ git commit
```
It will open a text editor (most likely _nano_) in which you can type a description of the changes you made.

If your commit message is short you can skip opening the editor and set the commit message directly in the command:
```
$ git commit -m <message>
``` 
---
## PUSHING YOUR CHANGES TO A REMOTE
Pushing changes is basically uploading them to a remote server.
You do that simply by typing:
```
$ git push
```
<span class="audience-question">Hmm, it doesn't seem to work...</span>

Ah, of course. We haven't set up a `remote` yet, that's why <span class="git">Git</span> doesn't know where to push the changes.

A `remote`, which as name suggests, is a remote repository corresponding to the local one.

---
## PUSHING YOUR CHANGES TO A REMOTE
To add a new `remote` to the repository use the following command:
```
$ git add remote origin <repo-url>
```
`repo-url` is the  URL of the repo you're gonna create on <span class="git">Git</span>Hub - right now!
\
\
All done? Let's try with the push one more time.

<!-- <span class="audience-question">Hey it works!</span> -->

# TIME FOR A BREAK üïö

Create a 2-3 person groups as we'll be covering teamwork with <span class="git">Git</span>.

---
## CLONING A <span class="git">GIT</span> REPOSITORY
Let's start by cloning this repo: [repolinkTODO]()

```
$ git clone repolinkssshTODO
```

**_NOTE_:** When cloning a repo it will create the directory with the exact name as the repo and put all the contents there. 
No need to create an additional directory for it.
