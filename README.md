# GIT GUD

A small git CLI workshop prepared for people that haven't used git before, haven't used it in a while, used it very sparsely or would like to learn CLI instead of GUI. 

---
## PREREQUISITES
 - Git 
- Python 3 

If something is missing go to [Setup](#setup) section.

Once you have everything you're free to get started!
 
## SETUP
### Installing Git
Git installation is a rather straightforward process, just go to [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads), pick your operating system (OS) and follow the instructions.

Git comes installed by default on most Mac machines and Linux distributions. So you who are working on these operating systems are in luck. To make sure you have it installed open a terminal and type
```
$ git --version
```
If the command executes succesfully and you get an output that looks similar to this: `git version 2.25.1`, then you have git installed.

If not, refer to the link above and follow instructions (which are mainly typing in 1-2 commands into your terminal).

### Installing Python
[This article on RealPython](https://realpython.com/installing-python/) (great Python blog BTW) explains everything much better than I would ever have. Just find your OS and follow the instructions.

Similar to git, Python comes preinstalled on most Mac machines and Linux distributions. You can check if you have one installed similarily to git. Just open your terminal and type in: 
```
$ python --version
```
If the output looks similar to this: `Python 3.9.7` you have **Python 3** installed.

**Note** that I said Python 3, since some on some OS Python 2 can be installed along Python 3. if that is the case refer to the linked article above.
